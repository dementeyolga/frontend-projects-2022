Hello everyone!

My name is Olga, I'm from Minsk, Belarus and I'm a student of the Rolling Scopes School front-end course. I have a University degree in a different field but while studying at the university I realized that I'm not kind of interested in this field but I want to become a front-end developer. And for now I want to become a really qualified specialist and find a job.

Speaking about my skills and experience, I think that I have a confident knowledge of such web development technologies as HTML, CSS, SCSS, Vanilla JS, Git and Webpack.

Speaking about some recent challenges, the most challenging task was the 15 game, I guess. I enjoyed implementing the algorithm for solvability and also it was quite interesting to use localStorage to save the state of the game and the top 10 results.

Another interesting task was Online Zoo, because it was quite complex and it included different parts, first of all, basic markup, then adaptive design, adaptive layout and also adding some interactive elements to this project. So it was quite interesting to complete all the requirements step by step and come to the final solution.

And one more curious task for me was HTML-Builder, which required some knowledge of Node.js. It was quite a challenge to dive into the whole new ecosystem and try my best to solve this task.

Also I had some real-life work experience with front-end. I primarily developed adaptive web pages with interactive elements using HTML, CSS, SCSS and Vanilla JS, including writing 
HTTP requests, making basic form validation and DOM manipulations. What's more, I tried to learn React.js. I created basic React.js applications using Hooks and custom components.

And speaking about my further plans, I really wish to learn React, because, as I've already mentioned, I've already touched upon this library and I liked it a lot and I guess it would be a great experience to learn this library and to use it in my future job.

So summing everything up, I am more than eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills and I'm really motivated to become a skilled developer and find my dream job.

So thanks for your attention and good luck!
